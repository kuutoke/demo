        I'm so happy<br />I'm afraid I'll die<br />Here in your arms<br />What would you do<br />If I died<br />Like this<br />Right now<br />Here in your arms?
    </p>
    <p>
        That we ever should have met<br />Is a miracle
    </p>
    <p>
        <li><strong>[GIORGIO]</strong></li>
        No, inevitable—
    </p>
    <p>
        <li><strong>[CLARA]</strong></li>
        Then inevitable, yes<br />But I confess<br />It was the look—
    </p>
    <p>
        <li><strong>[GIORGIO]</strong></li>
        The look?
    </p>
    <p>
        <li><strong>[CLARA]</strong></li>
        The sadness in your eyes<br />That day<br />When we glanced<br />At each other in the park

    [GIORGIO]
We were both unhappy

[CLARA]
Unhappiness can be seductive

[GIORGIO]
You pitied me

[BOTH]
How quickly pity leads to love

[CLARA]
All this happiness
Merely from a glance in the park
So much happiness
So much love

[GIORGIO]
I thought I knew what love was

[CLARA]
I wish we might have met so much sooner
I could have given you—

[GIORGIO]
I thought I knew what love was


[CLARA]
—My youth

[GIORGIO]
I thought I knew how much I could feel

[CLARA]
All the time we lost...

[GIORGIO]
I didn't know what love was

[CLARA]
I've never known what love was
[GIORGIO]
But now—	[CLARA]
And now—
[BOTH]
— I do
It's what I feel with you
The happiness I feel with you

[CLARA]
So much happiness

Happening by chance in a park

Surely, this is happiness

No one else has ever felt before!	[GIORGIO]

You are so beautiful...

Not by chance
By necessity

By the sadness that we saw in each other.
[BOTH]
Just another love story
That's what they would claim
Another simple love story
Aren't all of them the same?

[CLARA]
No, but this is more
We feel more!

[BOTH]
This is so much more!
Like every other love story
Some say happiness
Comes and goes
Then this happiness
Is a kind of happiness
No one really knows

[GIORGIO]
I thought I knew what love was

[CLARA]
I'd only heard what love was

[GIORGIO]
I thought it was no more than a name for yearning

[CLARA]
I thought it was what kindness became

[GIORGIO]
I'm learning

[CLARA]
I thought where there was love there was shame

[GIORGIO]
That with you

[CLARA]
But with you

[BOTH]
There's just happiness

[CLARA]
Endless happiness...

(spoken)
What?

[GIORGIO, spoken]
I've been transferred to the Fourth Brigade
Oh, Clara, please don't look so sad

[CLARA, spoken]
You're the one that makes me happy

[GIORGIO]
God, you are so beautiful
I love to see you in the light
Clear and beautiful, memorize
Every inch
Every part of you
To take with me

[CLARA, spoken]
Giorgio...

[GIORGIO]
Your feet so soft
As if they'd never touched the ground

[CLARA, spoken]
I must go...

[GIORGIO]
Your skin so white, so pure, so delicate
Your smell so sweet, your breathe so warm
I will summon you in my mind
I'm painting you indelibly on my mind

[CLARA]
Let me go

[GIORGIO]
We must fill every moment

[CLARA]
All this happiness ended by a word in the dark

[GIORGIO]
Oh my love, oh my darling

[CLARA]
So much happiness wasn't meant to last

[GIORGIO]
I am here
I am with you
I am yours

[CLARA]
I never knew what love was

[GIORGIO]
Your skin
Your silken hair
Your breasts, your lips
I want you every minute of my life

I will always be here	[CLARA]

I always thought I didn't deserve it
I didn't know what love was
I don't know how I'll live when you're gone!
[CLARA]
I don't know how I'll live
Giorgio!
Don't leave me -->
