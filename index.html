        <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
        <p>
          I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes<br />
          And<br />
          I certainly haven't been spreading myself around<br />
          I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb<br />
          But I'm good at being uncomfortable so<br />
          I can't stop changing all the time
        </p>
        <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
        <p>
          I noticed that my opponent is always on the go<br />
          And<br />
          Won't go slow, so 's not to focus, and I notice<br />
          He'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as<br />
          They go fast from whence he came<br />
          But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so<br />
          He can't stop staying exactly the same
        </p>
        <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
        <p>
          <br />If there was a better way to go then it would find me<br />I
          can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me<br />Be kind to me,
          or treat me mean<br />I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary
          machine
        </p>
        <h4>[Verse 3]</h4>
        <p>
          <br />I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day<br />You deem me
          due to clean my view and be at peace and lay<br />I mean to prove I
          mean to move in my own way and say<br />I've been getting along for
          long before you came into the play
        </p>
        <h4>[Verse 4]</h4>
        <p>
          <br />I am the baby of the family, it happens<br />So<br />Everybody
          cares and wears the sheeps' clothes<br />While they chaperone<br />Curious,
          you looking down your nose at me, while you appease<br />Courteous, to
          try and help<br />But let me set your mind at ease
        </p>
        <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
        <p>
          <br />If there was a better way to go then it would find me<br />I
          can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me<br />Be kind to me,
          or treat me mean<br />I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary
          machine
        </p>
        <h4>[Bridge]</h4>
        <p>
          <br />Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?<br />It's very
          kind <br />But it's to no avail; and I don't want the bail<br />I
          promise you, everything will be just fine
        </p>
        <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
        <p>
          <br />If there was a better way to go then it would find me<br />I
          can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me<br />Be kind to me,
          or treat me mean<br />I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary
          machine<br />If there was a better way to go then it would find me<br />I
          can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me<br />Be kind to me,
          or treat me mean<br />I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary
          machine
